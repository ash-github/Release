# Release
Release folder of all projects.

**Read the [LICENSE](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/blob/master/LICENSE.md) first.**

Download code from [public releases](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/releases) to get the latest stable release. Code from this repo is also usable but I don't make any promise. I will only make a new release when I think the code is ready to update.
